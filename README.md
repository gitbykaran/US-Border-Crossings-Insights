# Project Overview

This project analyzes U.S. border crossing entry data to uncover trends, seasonal patterns, and insights related to the types of ports, transportation methods, and volumes of border crossings.

## 📁 Dataset

**Source**: [U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP)]   
**Features include**:
- **Port Name**: Name of the border port
- **State**: State where the port is located

- **Date**: Date of record
- **Measure**: Mode of crossing (e.g., Pedestrians, Vehicles, Buses)
- **Value**: Count of crossings
- **Location**: Geographical coordinates

## 📊 Project Goals

- Identify the busiest border crossing locations
- Compare traffic between the northern and southern borders
- Detect seasonal trends in border crossings
- Analyze mode-of-transport usage over time

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** – Data cleaning and visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** – For exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- **MySQL** - Data Insights through queries.
